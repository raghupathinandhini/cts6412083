# Java FSE 4.0 – Mandatory Hands-On by CTS

This repository features a collection of hands-on Java exercises created as part of the **DN 4.0 Full Stack Engineer (FSE)** learning program at **Cognizant (CTS)**. 
These exercises are intended to deepen your practical knowledge of essential Java development principles, such as design patterns, algorithms, and data structures, 
through engaging and structured mini-projects.



##  Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement popular **design patterns**
- Practice building scalable applications using **clean OOP design**
- Analyze and optimize solutions with **time complexity (Big O notation)**
- Improve problem-solving using **data structures and algorithms**



##  Contents
###  Design Patterns and Principles

1. **Singleton Pattern** –  Single-instance logging utility  
2. **Factory Method Pattern** –  Document generation (Word, PDF, Excel)  

###  Algorithms and Data Structures
 
1. **E-commerce Search Function** –  Linear and Binary Search with time complexity analysis
2. **Financial Forecasting system**- Predict revenue using historical data(Moving Average/Regression)
